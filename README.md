## System Scenario

This section describes a typical scenario illustrating the operation of the Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) in a real-world context.

### Scenario: Morning Commute During Peak Hours

**Actors Involved:**
-   Ms. Sara Khalid (Commuter)
-   Mr. Ahmed Rashid (Public Transport Operator)
-   Traffic Police Officer Ahmed Saeed Al-Mansouri
-   Emergency Traffic Dispatcher Mohammed Yasin Al-Matrai
-   IT & AI Engineer Eng. Hisham Al-Mansoori

**Flow of Events:**

1.  **7:00 AM - Initial Traffic Monitoring:**
    -   The STMS, through its network of IoT sensors and CCTV cameras, begins monitoring traffic flow across the city as the morning peak hour approaches.
    -   AI algorithms analyze real-time data, identifying areas where traffic density is increasing and predicting potential congestion hotspots.
    -   Eng. Hisham Al-Mansoori, the IT & AI Engineer, reviews system dashboards, ensuring all sensors are online and data streams are healthy.

2.  **7:30 AM - Congestion Detection and Signal Optimization:**
    -   The system detects a significant increase in traffic volume at a major intersection leading to the city center.
    -   The AI-powered dynamic traffic signal control module automatically adjusts the signal timings at this intersection and surrounding ones to prioritize the heavier flow, reducing waiting times.
    -   Traffic Police Officer Ahmed Saeed Al-Mansouri observes the improved flow on his in-vehicle display, confirming the system's effectiveness.

3.  **8:00 AM - Commuter Navigation:**
    -   Ms. Sara Khalid, a daily commuter, opens her STMS mobile app to check her route to work. The app, leveraging real-time traffic data, recommends an optimal route that avoids the previously congested intersection, suggesting a slightly longer but faster alternative.
    -   She accepts the recommendation, and the app provides turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation.

4.  **8:15 AM - Public Transport Optimization:**
    -   Mr. Ahmed Rashid, a public transport operator, is driving his bus along a route that typically experiences delays. His vehicle's dashboard, integrated with the STMS, receives real-time updates.
    -   The system advises him of a minor accident ahead on his usual route and suggests a slight detour to maintain his schedule, which he follows.

5.  **8:30 AM - Accident Detection and Emergency Response:**
    -   A minor fender-bender occurs on a highway exit ramp. The STMS's computer vision system immediately detects the incident.
    -   An alert is automatically sent to Emergency Traffic Dispatcher Mohammed Yasin Al-Matrai, who sees the precise location and severity on his console.
    -   The system also notifies Traffic Police Officer Ahmed Saeed Al-Mansouri, who is patrolling nearby. The STMS prioritizes emergency vehicle routing, creating a 


green wave for him to reach the scene quickly.

6.  **8:45 AM - Post-Incident Analysis and Reporting:**
    -   Once the accident is cleared, the STMS logs the incident details, including response times and traffic impact.
    -   Eng. Hisham Al-Mansoori receives an automated report on the incident, which will be used for further analysis to improve system performance and identify accident-prone areas.

This scenario demonstrates how the STMS, powered by AI, seamlessly integrates various functionalities to enhance urban mobility, improve safety, and provide efficient traffic management, benefiting commuters, public transport operators, and emergency services alike.
